# TODO list
- [ ] Implement the **Cross Interpolation** algorithm without memory limit.
- [ ] Implement the **Tensor Cross Interpolation** algorithm without memory limit.
- [ ] Implement the **Cross Interpolation** algorithm with memory limit.
- [ ] Implement the **Tensor Cross Interpolation** algorithm with memory limit.
- [ ] Revise the implementation with partial rank-revealing LU decomposition for better numerical stability.

# Notes
- With a little pre-experiments, it seems rook search cost less runtime memory even when the full tensor fits in memory.
